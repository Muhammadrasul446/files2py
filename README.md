# files2py

## About project
This projects was created for converting multiple files into one *.py file. Using that *.py file in output you can restore your data by just typing ```python3 *.py``` (name of file where *).

## Instruction
When you will launch files2py.py you will be asked for typing a path to file. You can choose different files as you wish.  
If you have finished with typing files then input ```done()``` and if you mentioned any file, you will be asked to input an outputing *.py filename. When you do that, you will get an outputted file. So you can use for launching in python3 and restore your files.
### Notice
If you will not give a filename to outputting file then it will be named None.py by default.
